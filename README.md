### <samp>Assignment Description:</samp>

> You will be building a Github Repository for each of your homework assignments for Authoring 1. Use these repositories to complete the requirements for each assignment. After the initial submission, you **DO NOT NEED TO RESUBMIT to FOL**. Just update the main branch with pull requests, commits and merges.

### <samp>Assignment Requirements:</samp>

> Create a repository on Github for each homework assignment (refer to the appropriate section in the course content for number of assignment repos you'll need).

> Add the required content to the Readme file, using the template provided as a reference.

> Make sure to implement these edits on a new branch - NEVER work directly on the main
branch.

> Create the correct project structure - files and folders - for each assignment.
Push the changes to your repo and merge those changes to the main branch.
Submit your Github repo link to FOL.
